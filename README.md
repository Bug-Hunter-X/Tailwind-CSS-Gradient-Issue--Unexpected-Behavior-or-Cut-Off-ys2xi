# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS's gradient functionality. The gradient either doesn't render correctly or is unexpectedly cut off.

## Problem Description

The provided HTML code snippet uses the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class to create a linear gradient. However, the actual rendering differs from what's expected. The gradient may not be displayed at all, or portions of the gradient may be missing.

## Solution

The issue stems from potential conflicts with other CSS rules or an incorrect understanding of how Tailwind CSS gradients are applied. To resolve this:

1. Ensure that there are no conflicting CSS rules overriding the gradient styles.
2. Verify that the necessary Tailwind directives are properly configured and included in your project.
3. Try specifying explicit width and height values for the container element to ensure that the gradient is rendered correctly within its bounds.
4. If using a framework or component library, check its documentation to ensure compatibility with Tailwind's gradient utilities.
